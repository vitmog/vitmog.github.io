# Steel Anthill toy model

All of the model parameters are the same as in [Concrete Anthill](anthill.md) but steel is used as a shielding material instead of concrete one.

Computed flux functional - ambient equivalent dose H*(10) [1] rates, the thickness of volumetric detectors are 100 cm.
Below, some results of neutron-gamma and gamma problems 20.5 hours long computation are presented.
