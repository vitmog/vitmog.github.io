# Concrete Anthill toy model

This model imitates a hypothetical large spent fuel dry storage. It has heterogeneous concrete shields including numerous labyrinths, rooms, and cavities of intractable configurations. An interesting feature of the designed problem is the relatively strong attenuation of dose rates for both neutrons and gamma radiation which magnitudes reach $10^{-15} - 10^{-19}$. In combination with a large heterogeneous self-shielded source, that makes this problem suitable for practicing in variance reduction techniques for full-scale shielding evaluations.

The model is based on a regular $61 \times 61$ lattice of $25 \times 25 \times 410$ cm prisms. In the central $21 \times 21$ cells fragment, 441 PWR spent fuel assemblies from the [CASTOR-V/21](castor-v21.md) model are placed. The remaining part of the model is a complex heterogeneous shield and its prisms are filled with either concrete or air (see Figure 1). In total, shield thicknesses in each side direction are equal to 500 cm but shield thickness of the monolite concrete slab in the top direction is 400 cm.
