# CASTOR-V/21 spent fuel cask

The next load of the CASTOR-V/21 fuel cask [1] is considered below:
 * 10 spent $15 \times 15$ PWR fuel assemblies of 3.11 wt.% initial enrichment, 35.7 GWd/MTU burn-up, and 46 months cooling time;
 * 7 quadratic combined absorbers which consist of two coaxial polyethylene and lead prisms of inradius 7 cm and 10.5 cm respectively;
 * 4 empty positions.

Computed flux functional - ambient equivalent dose H*(10) [2] rates.

Several computations cases results are provided:
 1. Single cask (total running time - 13.5 hours);
 2. Additional calculation for the single cask side surface primary gamma dose rates distribution (total running time - 25.2 hours);
 3. The cask is located in the center of $10^5$ cm air sphere inside a hypothetical labyrinth-like absorbing either polyethylene or lead construction which is designed for domination of the skyshine effect in radiation transfer (total running time - 12.6 hours);
 4. The same as above model but the construction has an air-filled perforation of 100 cm radius on 2500 cm height above the cask bottom (total running time - 12.7 hours).

Below, the results of the neutron-gamma and gamma problems computations are performed (see details in [3]).
