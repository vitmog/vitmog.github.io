# Autobiography

I began my research career as a student of P.A. Androsenko in 2007. He was the creator of the BRAND (BRothers ANDrosenko) Monte Carlo complex of codes for numerical simulation of quite wide range of physical processes such as neutral and charged particle transport, thermal conduction, etc. Started from P.A. Androsenko's ideas and under his mentoring, I designed, implemented in BRAND, and investigated three variance reduction techniques of Monte Carlo for particle transport: double point estimator, combined point and double point estimator, and non-analog azimuth scattering angle sampling. The results were included in my Specialist's degree thesis titled "Development of the Monte Carlo method non-analog modifications for shielding evaluations". Since 2011, I have been developing and maintaining the BRAND Monte Carlo codes for neutron and gamma particle transport as an independent researcher.

My experience involves working as a modelling engineer in industry from 2011 to 2021. In this role, I provided criticality, depletion, and shielding evaluations for design and optimization of spent fuel and radioactive waste equipment (primarily spent fuel casks) to support the design process by construction optimizations and to review of the completed projects by regulatory authorities. The shielding evaluations were performing using BRAND and it soon became clear that many practical problems of radiation shielding R&D can be efficiently resolved by designing advanced Monte Carlo particle transport algorithms and approaches.

During this period, I combined my role as a modeling engineer with independent research activity for design and implementation of novel Monte Carlo algorithms required for solving the actual problems. As a result, an original Monte Carlo scheme for neutral particles shielding numerical simulation was designed. The scheme recommended itself in practice and some parts of it have been presented at several scientific conferences in Russia. This scheme is still under development and currently includes the following: exponential transform modification for convex shields, multi-case computations techniques, coupled location-direction source importance sampling technique, and adaptive automated splitting technique. Additionally, multi-kernel geometry module and automated producing spent fuel qualification tables scheme for cask were designed, which most likely can be categorized as engineering projects rather than scientific research ones. Some results of the scheme usage can be found [here](shielding-evaluations.md).

Generally, my research interest focuses on Monte Carlo numerical solutions of the Fredholm integral equations via various approaches and of partial differential equations using the Feynman-Kac formula. I am currently working on Monte Carlo applications for fixed source neutral and charged particle transport problems and the design of novel efficient techniques and approaches to them.
