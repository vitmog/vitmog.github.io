# CASTOR-V/21 multicase computations

For the given [model](castor-v21.md) of the isolated CASTOR-V/21 cask, those are considered additional 5 cases for each type of radiation defined using the cask side wall shield cutting by cylindrical surfaces. These 6 cases in total have been completed in a single computation of total running time 12.1 hours using the multithickness Monte Carlo technique [2].

Computed flux functional - ambient equivalent dose H*(10) [1] rates.

Below, the obtained results of neutron-gamma and gamma problems calculations are performed (see details in [2]).
