# Protvino concrete labyrinth benchmark (ALARM-CF-AIR-LAB-001)

A californium-252 neutron source of intensity $5.66 \cdot 10^8$ n/s is located on entrance to a 3-section concrete labyrinth [1].
The goal is computation of spatial distribution of a neutron flux linear functional which relates to the Bonner sphere detector count rates.
Those are considered Case 5A (2 polyethylene plates in the 2nd section) and Case 6B (covered source and dead-end).

Computed flux functional - pulse rate by the detector response function is taken from the benchmark data for the case of 5 in. Bonner polyethylene sphere diameter.

Thicknesses of volumetric detectors are equal to 10 cm.
Results of the two 11.2 hours long concurrently ran computations are performed in Figures 3-5 (see details in [2]).
